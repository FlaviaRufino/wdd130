    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Flavia and I am from Sao Paulo, Brazil but I had lived in Maryland, United States and nowadays I am spending a time in Dublin, Ireland to help my husband to improve his English.
       I am 24 years old and I love travelling. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking and baking; for me it is a very practical way to serve and demonstrate love for others. I have been married for the last 1 year and 3 months and this is the most important part of my life, I have been learning a lot, my husband is such an amazing person and I am very grateful for him. I am a resilient person and I can ajust very well with challenging, new and different situations, people and places. I have done this course before but I failed however I will not give up; even though the challenges might appear I will give my best this time to keep good grades along the course. 
       I am so happy and excited to develop new skills and to gain more knowledge.</p>
